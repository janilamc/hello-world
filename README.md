Hello! 

Janila here, I enjoy listening to different types of music, depending on my mood. While I study, it's usually something acoustic or lofi hip hop. I like to enjoy a snack and a warm beverage during most study sessions. 
I look forward to learning about front end development. I have never written a line of code before but I have always enjoyed dabbling around with HTML and CSS on websites like myspace or tumblr. 
I always thought that I would never commit to the idea of being a programmer but sometimes life has a funny way of pushing you towards things you have always wanted to accomplish. 
My dream is to have the luxury of travelling with my work as I have a strong desire to experience different cultures all over the world.
